What is mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation,
 and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation
of those objects in MongoDB.

        .then(()=>{
            console.log("success"); // IF CONNECTION MADE SUCCESSFULLY
        }).catch((err) =>{
            console.log(err,"error"); // IF CONNECTION HAS ISSUE
        })
